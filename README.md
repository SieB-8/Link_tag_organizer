Link tag organizer is a tool to help you save and organize links, especially video links. For now only Youtube links are supported.

To open the program, you must run the 'run.bat' file. This will launch a local server and open the program in your default browser.

You can search trough your posts with the help of tags. When you click on (the border of) a post, you will see an enlarged version of the post, as well as all it's tags.
While you are viewing a post, you can scroll down to give or remove a like and to edit the post's tags.

If you go to "Add post" (via the header) you can add posts and tags. You only need to create tags that do not fit in the "general" category.

For now there are no suggestions for tags when typing in the search bar.

! At the moment you must press ctrl+C in the terminal to close the local server !
