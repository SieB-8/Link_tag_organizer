Link tag organizer is a tool to help you save and organize links. I'm planning on embedding certain link types like youtube video's.
To open the program, you must run the 'run.bat' file. This will launch a local server and open the program in your default browser.
! At the moment you must press ctrl+C in the terminal to close the local server !
